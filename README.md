# SQL Challenge
Designed tables to hold data in CSVs, import the CSVs into a SQL database, and answer questions about the data by performing Data Engineering and Data Analysis. 


#### Data Modeling
Inspected the CSVs and sketched out an ERD of the tables using (http://www.quickdatabasediagrams.com).

#### Data Engineering

* Used the information to create a table schema for each of the six CSV files, specifying data types, primary keys, foreign keys, and other constraints.

#### Data Analysis

1. Listed the following details of each employee: employee number, last name, first name, sex, and salary.

2. Listed first name, last name, and hire date for employees who were hired in 1986.

3. Listed the manager of each department with the following information: department number, department name, the manager's employee number, last name, first name.

## Additional review - SQLAlchemy
